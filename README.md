# 🧩 n8n Workflows Collection

Welcome to my **n8n Workflows Repository**!  
This repo contains the workflows I created while exploring and working with **[n8n](https://n8n.io/)** — a powerful workflow automation tool that lets you connect APIs, apps, and services with ease.

All workflows shared here are **free to use**, **modify**, and **learn from**.  
However, if you decide to use them in your own projects or share them publicly, please **give proper credit** 🙏
